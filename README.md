# Interesting Snippets

A collection of short snippets that I found interesting. I do not necessarily agree with the views - they simply succintly and clearly say what I believe to be an interesting topic or insight. 

## On Altruism 

From [Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/altruism/#DesiMoti):

*This thesis that what motivates us to act is always a desire should be accepted only if we have a good understanding of what a desire is. If a desire is simply identified with whatever internal state moves someone to act, then the claim, “what motivates us to act is always a desire”, when spelled out more fully, is a tautology. It says: “the internal state that moves us to act is always the internal state that moves us to act”. That is not a substantive insight into human psychology, but a statement of identity, of the form “A = A”. We might have thought we were learning something about what causes action by being told, “what motivates people is always a desire”, but if “desire” is just a term for whatever it is that motivates us, we are learning nothing (see Nagel 1970: 27–32).*

and

*To take matters to an extreme, it might be suggested that our ultimate motivation is always entirely other-regarding. According to this far-fetched hypothesis, whenever we act for our own good, we do so not at all for our own sake, but always entirely for the sake of someone else. The important point here is that the denial that altruism exists should be regarded with as much suspicion as this contrary denial, according to which people never act ultimately for their own good. Both are dubious universal generalizations. Both have far less plausibility than the common sense assumption that people sometimes act in purely egoistic ways, sometimes in purely altruistic ways, and often in ways that mix, in varying degrees, the good of oneself and the good of others*

## On Perfect Secret Sharing

From [Adi Shamir's 1979 Perfect Secret Sharing paper](shamir.pdf)

*Some of the useful properties of this (k, n) threshold scheme (when compared to the mechanical locks and keys solutions) are:*

 *(1) The size of each piece does not exceed the size of the original data.*

 *(2) When k is kept fixed, D~ pieces can be dynamically added or deleted (e.g., when executives join or leave the company) without affecting the other D i pieces. (A piece is deleted only when a leaving executive makes it completely inaccessible, even to himself.)*

*(3) It is easy to change the D i pieces without changing the original data D--all we need is a new polynomial q(x) with the same free term. A frequent change of this type can greatly enhance security since the pieces exposed by security breaches cannot be accumulated unless all of them are values of the same edition of the q(x) polynomial.*

 *(4) By using tuples of polynomial values as Di pieces, we can get a hierarchical scheme in which the number of pieces needed to determine D depends on their importance. For example, if we give the company's president three values of q(x), each vice-president two values of q(x), and each executive one value of q(x), then a (3, n) threshold scheme enables checks to be signed either by any three executives, or by any two executives one of whom is a vice-president, or by the president alone.*


 ## On Planned Obsolesence

 From [u/Awesomebox5000 on a thread on planned lifecycles](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/6dtze8/postmarketos_aiming_for_a_10_year_lifecycle_for/di5kfe2/)

 Planned obsolescence doesn't really exist in the way most people think it exists. Manufacturing processes have matured to the point that we can design a product where the average unit will last *at least* a certain period of time with the estimates on "at least" getting better all the time. People keep demanding products to be cheaper and cheaper so companies build less and less durability in the products. They're designed to last at least a certain period of time, not self-destruct after a certain period of time; it's actually REALLY HARD to make something purposefully fail at the exact moment you want it to without being obviously designed to fail.

Basically, it used to be that we had to overbuild the shit out of *everything* in order to ensure that it would work **at all**; this led to a lot of products that were needlessly expensive. Take a blender for example, the first price point I could find for a household blender was from [1937 at a price of $29.75](http://www.angelfire.com/ns2/mixerhistory/). Adjusted for inflation, that's over $500 today; which also happens to be around the price point you need to get a brand new blender that will last for decades. You don't *have to* spend that much money on a blender because there are much cheaper options available that aren't designed to last as long but the cheaper blenders aren't designed to fail, they're designed to be less expensive which, necessarily, reduces the average lifespan of the product.

There are totally a few classic planned obsolescence examples out there; but the majority of the time people are just expecting their walmart blender to last as long as a Blendtec. Most of what people feel is planned obsolescence can really be explained by the Terry Pratchett quote about boots:

> The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.

> Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.

> But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.

> This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.


## On Modern Political Thought

From [u/TheVetSarge on a thread after the 2016 Presidential Election](https://www.reddit.com/r/television/comments/5dfsau/cbs_this_morning_jon_stewart_on_presidentelect/da4jxwv/)


In the midst of all the crying and hand-wringing about racists, people seem to have forgotten that there are people who will always vote Republican because Republicans back the things they think are important, just like there are people who will always vote Democrat because they think Democrats back the things they think are important.

The majority of racists probably voted for Donald Trump. This doesn't mean the majority of people who voted for Donald Trump are racists. They voted for Donald Trump not *because* he was a dickhead. They voted for him *in spite of it*. My cousin's wife's parents are old school Virginia Republican. When my mom (die hard SoCal urban Clinton supporter) asked her who they were voting for she said (back in May) "Well, it looks like it may be Donald Trump".  These are normal, nice, non-racist people. But they are economically conservative Republicans. Hillary Clinton and the Democrats don't represent their values and while they may not *like* Donald Trump's comments, those aren't their core issues.

If you are Pro-2A, you don't care about grabbed pussies. You care about keeping another Sotomayer off the Supreme Court. If you're working class and you just missed the line for healthcare subsidies, Obamacare is hitting your wallet hard. You don't care about him saying mean things about some Mexican immigrants being criminals. Those aren't political issues that will affect your life. They're just mean things being said. 

Too many young Democrat voters (too many people in general) think voting is a question of feelings and feeling good about yourself at the end. It's *not*. And this is why Trump won. His voters don't *care* that he's a meaniehead. Winning the Presidential Election is about convincing the common schlub that he or she is voting in his or her own best interests. And I mean *thinking*. It doesn't matter if that isn't actually true. perception is reality.

## On Vagueness

From [Sorites Paradox](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sorites-paradox/)

*For example, the concept of a heap appears to lack sharp boundaries and, as a consequence of the subsequent indeterminacy surrounding the extension of the predicate ‘is a heap’, no one grain of wheat can be identified as making the difference between being a heap and not being a heap. Given then that one grain of wheat does not make a heap, it would seem to follow that two do not, thus three do not, and so on. In the end it would appear that no amount of wheat can make a heap. We are faced with paradox since from apparently true premises by seemingly uncontroversial reasoning we arrive at an apparently false conclusion.*
